# HackerEarth-Machine-Learning-Challenge---Credit-Scoring
Implementation of Logistic Regression and other machine learning algorithms to predict the credit score( Probability of Deafult) of a customer.


Built a Credit Scoring Model to predict the probability of default for a customer against his/her loan to reduce the NPA of the bank. 
The data included variables like the annual income, loan amount, loan default history, employment length, house mortgage, purpose of the  loan, type of application(single or joint) etc.
